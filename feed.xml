Milei is the current President of Argentina, and the podcast was heavily focused on Argentina’s economy and the measures Milei has taken to positively transform it. I’m not super familiar with Milei’s public policies and views, but I resonated with his economic stance and appreciated his identification as an Anarcho-Capitalist (a Minarchist in practice).</p>

<p>Milei explained that his economic views stem from the Austrian school of economics. I wanted to learn more, so I purchased <a href="https://mises.org/library/book/principles-economics">“Principles of Economics” by Carl Menger</a>, which is known as the foundation for this school of thought. I found a lot of Menger’s arguments novel and thought it’d be fun to try to formalize what I found most interesting. Also, by no means do I claim to be any sort of economist; I’m just a software engineer who took Economics 101 in university, read a bit of Smith and Menger, and listened to the All-In podcast one too many times. That being said, maybe someone else will find these points novel, so I’ll do my best in sharing them.</p>

<h2 id="value-is-subjective">Value is subjective</h2>

<p>This is the core principle underlying all of Menger’s arguments, and it’s arguably the only way to devise a correct formal methodology to explain how humans behave in the economy. Goods do not have an inherent value; their value is determined by people, and not everyone values a good equally.</p>

<p>It’s obvious but easily forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="goods-being-exchanged-are-not-equal-in-value">Goods being exchanged are not equal in value</h2>

<p>Since a good’s value is subjective, exchanges between individuals or organizations happen when each side values the other side’s good more highly than their own. To prove this, it’s pretty easy to come up with examples where two parties willingly enter an exchange but will refuse to reverse the exchange, which wouldn’t be the case if the goods being exchanged were truly equal.</p>

<p>For example, take an ex-artist turned aspiring musician and an ex-musician turned aspiring artist. The former is willing to exchange their art utensils for the latter’s guitar, and vice versa for the latter. Both parties benefit from the exchange, as they value the other party’s good more highly than their own. We can also easily see why neither party would be willing to revert the exchange, as this would mean they’re both acquiring a good of lower value to them.</p>

<p>One could argue that returns of goods happen all the time in retail. This is true, but it usually reflects a shift in the nature of the exchange. Now, the company isn’t simply getting the item back; it’s also regaining your trust, something they may value more than the original payment.</p>

<p>When working through examples, this principle also becomes very clear, yet it’s still highly overlooked.</p>

<h2 id="division-of-labor-is-not-everything">Division of labor is not everything</h2>

<p>Adam Smith championed the division of labor as the main boon to economic growth and the progression of society, and Menger acknowledges this and partially agrees with it. However, Menger argues that higher order goods are the other, and perhaps more important, key factor.</p>

<p>In case you’re not familiar with the ordering of goods, a first order good is something that directly satisfies a human need, while a higher order good (second, third, fourth, etc.) is a good that aids in the production of a lower order good and ultimately a first order good. For example, calories are a human need, and a medium rare ribeye steak would be a first order good that directly satisfies this need. In this scenario, some second order goods might be the raw steak, the chef who cooks the steak, and the salt that gets put atop it. Among many others, some third order goods might be the cow which provides the raw beef, the butcher, the butcher’s knife. Fourth order goods would be the farmer who takes care of the cow, the wood and the metal that comprise the knife, etc.. A near infinite order of goods can be extrapolated.</p>

<p>It is truly this early human recognition of higher order goods coupled with the division of labor that led to the rapid progression of our species and to the advancements of almost all aspects of society. With only the division of labor, early humans become hunters and gatherers, but not effective ones. They solely gather first order goods: berries, roots, bird eggs, seeds, etc., and they hunt with the most primitive tools, such as stones and wooden spears. It was only once humans started to recognize the importance of higher order goods that they were then able to effectively capitalize on this division of labor. Hunters move from using a wooden club to bow and arrow and to eventually a rifle, fishermen move from spear to fishing pole, and chance gathering of fruits and seeds progresses to advanced forms of agriculture. Division of labor without higher order goods is like an orchestra with no instruments: without any “instruments,” the “players” can’t effectively perform their specialized tasks, so the potential benefits of specialization never fully materialize.</p>

<h2 id="higher-order-goods-derive-all-of-their-value-from-the-first-order-goods-they-support-not-the-other-way-around">Higher order goods derive all of their value from the first order good(s) they support, not the other way around</h2>

<p>Though we now recognize higher order goods as being of the utmost importance to our society’s progression, it is only from the associated first order goods that they derive their value.</p>

<p>If the only use of the bespoke sewing machine (higher order good) is to aid in the production of a winter jacket (first order good - satisfies warmth), but winter has receded permanently (blame global warming or whatever you want, this is just an example), the winter jacket has no value, and hence the bespoke sewing machine also has no value. The same goes for the operator of the sewing machine, as the labor itself is also a higher order good aiding in the production of a useless first order good. One might argue that the operator must have value because of the tremendous effort they invest in producing this first-order good. But once again, if the first order good has no value to consumers in the perpetual summer, the associated higher order goods also have no value.</p>

<p>This seems to be a heavily misunderstood topic, and I think the problem stems from the conflation of value and price. It’s natural to think that if the price of a good is high, then the associated value is also high. This is blatantly false once viewed through the lens of subjective value. The high price of the good has the chance of correlating with value, but it’s not directly causal, as value is subjective to each individual and their circumstances. The fluctuation in price doesn’t change the value that someone places on a good, it just changes that person’s ability to buy it.</p>

<p>A related concept that I found interesting was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect">Baumol’s Cost Disease</a>, which explains how wages in sectors with little productivity growth still tend to rise when other, more productive sectors push overall wage levels higher. A classic illustration is a live concert: the orchestra can’t simply double its productivity without doubling its musicians, so if industries elsewhere in the economy are driving up wage expectations, the concert hall must also pay its performers more or else they’ll find higher paying jobs elsewhere. This raises ticket prices, even though the concert itself hasn’t become more valuable to attendees in terms of entertainment. The higher price of a burger or a laundromat visit doesn’t mean people value these things more than before; it just reflects wage growth outpacing productivity in those specific jobs.</p>

<p>Note: In this section, I’m mostly talking about “use value”, though this mostly holds for “exchange value” as well.</p>

<h2 id="money-arises-organically-from-human-desires-not-from-government-intervention">Money arises organically from human desires, not from government intervention</h2>

<p>Money is a construct needing zero government intervention to be conceived. As exchanges become more prominent in a society, a good’s exchange value becomes more and more recognized, and the concept of a commodity starts to form. The exchange value of a commodity is mainly determined by its marketability or how easily one can exchange this commodity for some other good. This marketability is important, for if a commodity is highly marketable, one can use it as an intermediary between the good they’re selling and the good they truly desire. This highly marketable commodity is a means to an end; it’s money. In <a href="https://brehonacademy.org/from-cows-to-coins-understanding-the-economics-of-early-ireland-and-the-role-of-brehon-law-in-trade-and-commerce/">some</a> <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/cattle-economy-maasai/">civilizations</a>, cattle acted as this intermediary good, and in others it was <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/11/08/362478685/from-salt-to-salary-linguists-take-a-page-from-science#:~:text=In%20Roman%20times%2C%20and%20throughout,with%20salt%20instead%20of%20money.">salt</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_money">cowry</a>. Eventually, precious metals took over due to their ease of preservation and divisibility. Money is the commodity with the highest marketability inside of a specific market or region. Money can and will arise organically within an economizing society, not due to government intervention. Menger acknowledges that government intervention does indeed have the ability to create its own money, as a stamp of approval can act as an easy verification of the money’s validity.</p>

<p>The point here is that while government coercion can definitely create markets and money, it is by no means necessary or the natural course of an economy.</p>

<h2 id="aggregate-statistics-are-not-the-final-story">Aggregate statistics are not the final story</h2>

<p>Over the past couple of years, I’ve started to feel a slight uncertainty for a lot of aggregate statistics presented. I don’t yet know how to feel about this distrust. I appreciate the skepticism I’ve developed, but it also sucks to not feel like I can trust a lot of the information I read online. Statistics themselves can be a very amazing and powerful tool, but these days it feels like they’re increasingly being used to coerce people who are numerically illiterate. Maybe I’ve just started to notice it more as I’ve grown older, but it feels dishonest and just frankly not cool. A rudimentary example is someone proclaiming, “Eating X increases your probability of getting Y disease by 85%,” without explicitly mentioning the perceived risk. There’s a huge difference between raising a 1% likelihood to 1.85% versus jumping from 1% to 86%. I do want to make it clear that I have immense respect for the other 99% of people using statistics for benevolence.</p>

<p>Aggregate statistics tend to leave out any trace of subjectivity. This is, by nature, their goal and purpose, yet it’s precisely why Menger criticized them. While pretty opinionated, I think <a href="https://mises.org/online-book/rothbard-reader/chapter-6-statistics-achilles-heel-government">this article</a> does a good job of summarizing my thoughts (or maybe my thoughts are a summarized version of this article lol). It’s true that data collection has seen vast improvements over the past decades since the article was written, but data collection is still very prone to lazy/deceptive individuals and poor datasets leading to false conclusions and mis/disinformation. As Bezos said, “When the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.”</p>

<p>Relating to present day economics, the poverty rate in Argentina is an example where aggregate statistics fall short. Shortly following Milei’s inauguration, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/argentina-poverty-milei-economy-crisis-f766deb9302aa4ddde1bb9ae26aaf7af#:~:text=Argentina%E2%80%99s%20poverty%20rate%20jumped%20from%20almost%2042%25%20to%2053%25">poverty rate in Argentina shot up from almost 42% to 53%</a>. Yikes. However, as Milei explains in his interview with Lex, he merely revealed the real poverty rate. Prices before Milei took office weren’t transparent because price controls were in place, and therefore it seemed as if people had more buying power, when in reality those prices put perverse incentives on the supply of goods. As Milei succinctly explains, it doesn’t matter how large the discount on butter is at the neighboring store if they’re out of stock.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not an economist. These are just my personal opinions stemming from things I’ve read and experiences I’ve had, so please feel free to reach out and correct me if you have opposing views on any of this!!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Economics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Takeaways from Menger]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How I Read</title><link href="https://parkerswanson19.github.io/writing/2023/reading-guidance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I Read" /><published>2023-10-22T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-22T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://parkerswanson19.github.io/writing/2023/reading-guidance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://parkerswanson19.github.io/writing/2023/reading-guidance/"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a close friend of mine asked me how I choose what books to read. Before this, I never explicitly thought about it and didn’t think I had any sort of framework. However, upon greater reflection, I realized there indeed are a few principles I try to follow these days for choosing what to consume and how.</p>

<p>Also, just a disclaimer that the following list is not all original ideas. It’s a curated list of mostly others’ principles that have well governed my decision making and yielded results I’m pleased with.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5><strong>1. Do your due diligence</strong></h5>
<p><br />
 Our time here on earth is finite. I have no desire to waste it reading something that’s neither enjoyable nor beneficial, and neither should you.</p>

<p>So how does one know whether a book is going to be a good read?</p>

<p>I think the number one thing that’s helped me has been recommendations. Upon finishing the “Almanack of Naval Ravikant”, I found the “Naval’s Recommended Reading” section very insightful. Here’s a <a href="https://nav.al/">man</a> who I look up to and respect highly, and I’ve just been gifted a list of his 50 favorite books. It’s truly been one of the best gifts. From that list I’ve read “Sapiens”, “Skin in the Game”, “Siddhratha”, and a few more, all without disappointment. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thejohnfish">John Fish</a> has also been a person who’s inspired me a lot in my reading journey, and his recommendations have also served me very well. My first book read for self fulfillment “Flow” was recommended by him, alongside two of my most recent reads: “Project Hail Mary” and “The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect”, which have both been excellent.</p>

<p>Find people that you respect and inspire you, and then find out what they’re reading. Chances are you’ll probably enjoy it and benefit from it. Some people I currently draw inspiration from are Naval Ravikant, Ray Dalio, the All-In podcast members, my family, my teammates, and my close friends.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h5><strong>2. It’s ok to put the book down. For good.</strong></h5>
<p><br />
Like I’m sure many can relate, I was taught through traditional education that finishing what you’ve started is the only option, so this simple concept was super novel to me. The revelation came to me after reading the “Almanack of Naval Ravikant” as mentioned above. Naval speaks upon how if you’re not enjoying the book, then don’t read it. Why waste your time doing something that’s not enjoyable? If you happen to mess up in choosing the book, you don’t need to suffer through it just because it’s already been chosen. That’s a sunk cost. Just put the book down and pick up a new one.</p>

<p>It’s important to distinguish between putting a book down because the content is uninteresting and not wanting to put in the effort to understand the subject. Learning new things isn’t easy, but overcoming the initial hurdles is essential for reaping the rewards of meaningful effort.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h5><strong>3. Don’t stress about retaining every single bit of information</strong></h5>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I’ve never been one to take an abundance of notes on the books I read. Unless it’s a technical book, it ruins the flow state I’m entranced in and diminishes the enjoyment that materializes when reading a good book. Even for technical books, I find that I absorb more by just reading and leaving the notes for another time, if at all.</p>

<p>This reading style may not suit everyone, but I think it’s important to incorporate, as I find it leads to reading for the sake of reading, as opposed to reading as a necessity/chore.</p>

<p>The same friend who sought advice on choosing what to read also introduced me to a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson: “I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.” I thought this quote was fantastic. Whether positive or not, it liberated me from the fear of forgetting, and it encouraged me to read more without fixating on meticulous details. Additionaly, I’ve found that reading relevant to my personal or professional life also helps me with retention, as I’m able to test the principles I encounter and get feedback on their efficacy.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h5><strong>4. Avoid reading materials authored solely for profit (non-fiction specific)</strong></h5>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Yet again, another principle stemming from Naval. It’s so simple and clear though, that I felt like I had to add it. It pretty much rules out all politician’s autobiographies, b-tier celebrities, and entrepreneurs selling step-by-step guides on “how to make money”. It allows you to hone in on people who are writing with the main goal of spreading knowledge and information. From my experience, I’ve found that these are usually people who don’t need the money from the book they’re writing, like startup founders or tenured professors. A simple way to “vet” an author is to explore their other works online and assess their utility: do they capture your interest, and can you apply their insights to your own life?`</p>

<p>This rule somewhat breaks down when it comes to fiction books, as authors do need to make money at the end of the day.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h5><strong>5. Self improvement/help books are good, but know when to stop</strong></h5>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m a big fan of self improvement / self help books or whatever label you want to give them. They kickstarted my reading journey, and I still pick one up every now and then. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Extreme Ownership, and even The Almanack of Naval Ravikant are all example of great self improvement books that have taught me a lot. Over time though, as you might’ve heard before, they start to become pretty repetitive. A lot of the books are built upon the same principles: consistency is key, take ownership of your actions and your life, focus on yourself and not others, work hard, etc. etc. While very valuable advice, I think solely reading these can lead to a narrow viewpoint, as you tend to hyperfocus on “bettering yourself” and in turn lose focus on just living your life. This leads me to my next point.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h5><strong>6. Don’t be afraid to venture into an unknown subject or genre</strong></h5>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Over the past couple of months, I’ve been really enjoying reading more technical books. The first of the likes was a book called “Designing Data-Intensive Applications”. I followed that with “Learning Go” and “Concurrency in Go”, and now “Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems”. Technical books were very foreign to me, but I wanted to read more stuff that was applicable to my daily work, and so I did. It’s turned out to be very rewarding so far.</p>

<p>Fiction is another genre that I was initially an outsider to. When I first started reading more seriously, I was only reading non-fiction. I did it mostly because I enjoyed it, but also due to me thinking it was the only option. I had a preconceived notion that fiction was for “kids” and that real progress is made with non-fiction books. And while I have found a lot of progress and substance in non-fiction books, I’ve started mixing in fiction books before I go to bed, and I’ve been really enjoying it. Some of my favorite books over the last year have been fiction: “Crime and Punishment”, “A Little Life”, and “Project Hail Mary”. The contrast in storytelling between fiction and non-fiction books is night and day, and I didn’t know how much I was missing out on it. Now I really look forward to reading my fiction book before I sleep every night.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h5><strong>7. At the end of the day, if you’re reading instead of going on social media or getting spoon fed dopamine in some other way, that’s a win. Keep doing what you’re doing. And if not, it’s never too late to start</strong></h5>
<p><br /></p>

<p>As you’ve likely heard from older generations, reading is good for you. Written information dates back to 3,500 BC, and learning to read opens doors to a world of insights and guidance. I know I mentioned above how it’s important to diligently choose the books you read, but most any reading is better than none, provided the material isn’t blatantly manipulative or biased (a pretty subjective determination). I think it’s crucial to keep your brain in a state where it’s able to read anything that’s thrown in its way. It’s the one consistent habit that I truly stand by, and it’s made my life better in numerous ways.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Looking back on it, “Guidance for Your Reading Journey” sounded a bit too pretentious and seemingly implied that I know wtf I’m talking about. To be clear, I don’t know; I just know what works for me. “How I Read” seemed a bit more fitting.</li>

Beautiful, but stressful. Regardless of our circumstances, there will always be things that divert our attention and test our resilience. In an effort not to combat these stressors but to accept them and manage them, I’ve developed what I like to call my inner mantra. <strong>Peace and Progress</strong>. Those are the two words I repeat to myself whenever life feels a little too demanding or those intrusive thoughts feel like they’re taking over. They remind me of my two core goals in life: <strong>to always be learning and to be a peaceful person</strong>. Everything else worthwhile in this world naturally follows.</p>

<p>I can’t strongly enough recommend that people develop their own inner mantra, as it works wonders. If you’re lost on how to develop one, think to yourself what your goals and values are and if they’d serve this purpose. Alternatively, selecting a favorite quote can serve as a powerful mantra. I previously used to have a quote as my inner mantra that served me well: “Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Peace" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inner Mantra]]></summary></entry></feed>
