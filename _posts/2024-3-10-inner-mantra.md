Life is stressful. Beautiful, but stressful. Regardless of our circumstances, there will always be things that divert our attention and test our resilience. In an effort not to combat these stressors but to accept them and manage them, I’ve developed what I like to call my inner mantra. **Peace and Progress**. Those are the two words I repeat to myself whenever life feels a little too demanding or those intrusive thoughts feel like they’re taking over. They remind me of my two core goals in life: **to always be learning and to be a peaceful person**. Everything else worthwhile in this world naturally follows. 

I can’t strongly enough recommend that people develop their own inner mantra, as it works wonders. If you're lost on how to develop one, think to yourself what your goals and values are and if they’d serve this purpose. Alternatively, selecting a favorite quote can serve as a powerful mantra. I previously used to have a quote as my inner mantra that served me well: “Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.”
